# Password-Based Door Lock System using Arduino

This project aims to develop a smart door lock system using Arduino Uno, providing excellent security and quick access. The hardware components required include Arduino Uno, a 16x2 LCD display, a 4x4 Matrix Keypad, and a Servo Motor.

## Design Simulation
To begin, we simulated the circuit design using the online software Tinkercad. The image below showcases the circuit design:
